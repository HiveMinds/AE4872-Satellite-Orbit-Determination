\section*{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this exam, in my opinion, questions are not put in a clear way. Presented solutions are concise, but long, elaborate descriptions (making perfect sense) would be possible as well. It is important to mind the notation and proper nomenclature (proper names of specific matrices and parameters). Moreover, it seems like year by year the questions are regarding more or less the same stuff (as indicated in the name of the exam parts).
